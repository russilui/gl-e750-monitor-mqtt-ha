# gl-e750-monitor-mqtt -- PRIVATE

My personal configuration based on [gl-e750-monitor repo](https://github.com/mazzz1y/gl-e750-monitor) using mqtt to publish data and alert messages to [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

## Requirements
1. Follow instructions in https://github.com/mazzz1y/gl-e750-monitor
2. Place alert.sh and monitor.sh in a folder of your choice (e.g. /monitor) on the Mudi
3. Make sure you give execution permission to both scripts
4. Use this example configuration in your Home Assitant configuration.yaml:
```

      device_class: "temperature"
